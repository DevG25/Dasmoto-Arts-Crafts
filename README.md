# Dasmoto-Arts & Crafts
Dasmoto is a Codecademy project. It is the first totally
off platform project to be performed on one's own device
with software totally set-up by one's self.
This project was the introduction to design specs (redline)
It is done with very little support from Codecademy.
They offer a support video incase you get stuck (I never used it).
I didn't make any additions of my own just followed the redline exactly.
I think that was the intention of the project. Other projects in this portfolio
will hopefuly demonstrate differnt skills and strengths.
Enjoy!
